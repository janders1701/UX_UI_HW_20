        <h1>National Weather Service Website Redesign <br>Case Study</h1>

        <h2>Weather.Gov Website Redesign</h2>
        <p>Project overview: The National Weather Service website is outdated and challenging to navigate. My redesign
            modernizes the interface, creating a pleasant and effective user experience. This will encourage users to
            return
            to the site and benefit from the information it provides.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h3>Role/Team</h3>
                <p>This was an individual project, so I was the UX researcher and UI designer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Figma, Google Sheets, Zoom</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h3>Client, Duration, Date</h3>
                <p>This was a 3 week project from start to finish</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/OGimage.png">

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Easily identify safety information for extreme weather conditions and situations to protect themselves
                and loved ones.
                Quickly find current whether conditions on a mobile device while out in nature that are easily readable
                on a small screen.
                Reduced clutter and text on each page for faster load times for important graphs, radar images etc on a
                mobile device.</p>
            <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
            <p>Key takeaways from interviewing users on the current site came down to outdated design, cluttered
                homepage and confusing navigation. It was important to identify the path the user had to take to get to
                certain areas of the website and how many clicks it took. To get to basic safety information about
                driving in a winter storm, it took users 4 steps and a lot of time looking for the right section to
                click on. 4 out of 5 users could not find what they were asked to find in testing.</p>

            <h3>User Path</h3>
            <img src="images/path.png">

            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>The redesigned NWS website allows users to easily access it on their mobile devices while outside or on
                the go. It features a readable layout, large action items to reduce clicking errors, and an intuitive
                organization with important information prominently displayed.</p>
            <img src="images/persona.png">

            <h3>Site Map</h3>
            <p>The navigation was streamlined to four options, plus a home option, to simplify the process for users to
                find what they need. The design prioritized simplification and organization.</p>
            <img src="images/sitemap.png">

            <h2>Concepts, Sketching, Wireframes</h2>
            <p>To accommodate users viewing on small screens, I designed an image carousel for the news section with
                large visuals that are easy to swipe through. I prioritized displaying the most important information
                and provided users the option to explore further if desired, effectively minimizing unnecessary clutter.
                <br>
                Initially, red was a primary color in the palette, but my research revealed that users preferred red to
                be reserved exclusively for warnings. Additionally, users favored having the weather displayed at the
                top, with the news below, as the weather was more important to them. Consequently, I revised the
                hierarchy from the first draft to better align with user preferences.
            </p>

            <h2>Visual Design & Prototype</h2>
            <p>The National Weather Service is a trusted source of information for users. Cleanliness and simplicity
                reflect reliability and accuracy while the warm pops of yellow symbolize a sunny day to help the user
                feel welcome.
                <br>
                I wanted a sans-serif font to maintain readability and clarity, emphasizing the importance of
                organization and accuracy while the flared serif font grabs users attention for important headlines and
                reflects a newspaper-like display of information that is dependable and trustworthy.

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>Using a tab system to click around the NWS website on mobile makes for a pleasant experience and easily
                visible navigation. The location toggle allows for effortless location recognition, and when toggled
                off, the user can search for any area in the country.

            <h2>Test: Validation, Usability, Feedback</h2>
            <p>I started with user tests over zoom, having users give their first impressions of the original site and
                giving them a few tasks to complete. The majority of the users could not complete either task and
                expressed frustration with the mobile website. </p>
            <p><b>Task: Navigate to graphical forecast</b><br>
                1. Hover over Forecast in navigation bar <br>
                2. Select Graphical
                <br><br>
                <b>Task: Find the newest news articles</b><br>
                1. Hover over the News navigation option<br>
                2. Select NWS News

            <h2>Challenges & Conclusion</h2>

            <div class="container-fluid">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Navigation Design</h3>
                        <p>Initially, I planned to use a hamburger menu for the navigation. This design was ideal for
                            including extensive information without cluttering the homepage. However, it also concealed
                            all options, requiring users to search for them. User tests revealed that making options
                            readily accessible without entering a menu was more effective for users to find what they
                            need at a glance. This taught me that user priorities should shape the visual design, even
                            if it deviates from the original idea. This principle is essential for all future projects.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Navigation Content</h3>
                        <p>The navigation menu had extensive contents. Due to time constraints, I couldn't incorporate
                            everything from the new site map into the final design, so I prioritized the most important
                            options based on user tests. If I revisit this project, I would include all options. I
                            learned
                            that for future projects, large navigation systems require adequate time to ensure
                            everything is
                            included.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <p>Overall, this challenge involved managing many moving parts as an individual. I appreciated the
                    opportunity to discuss and brainstorm ideas with my fellow classmates. I gained valuable insights
                    into
                    visual design based on user needs and how to implement these effectively. Determining when a project
                    is
                    truly complete can be challenging, but user tests conducted through various iterations helped guide
                    that
                    decision.</p>
